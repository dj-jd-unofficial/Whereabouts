# Components
## Header 
There is no particular reason as to why the header component is within a seperate 'components' directory. The header was the first component that I created, and I thought that I would place every component in this directory. I realized that for the purposes of this project that I wouldn't be using modules, therefore placing the components in another directory redunant. If you implenent modules, then it might make sense to use that directory. If you don't, clean it up.

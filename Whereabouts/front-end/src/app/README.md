# Components
## Header 
There is no particular reason as to why the header component is within a seperate 'components' directory. The header was the first component that I created, and I thought that I would place every component in this directory. I then realized that for the purposes of this project that I wouldn't be using modules, which made placing all of the components in another directory redunant. If you implenent modules, then it makes sense to use that directory. If you don't, remove it. 

The header contains a home link and sign in button. We had plans to host Whereabouts on Google Cloud Platform, and have individuals sign in with their Google accounts to play in real time. This button is a place holder for now.

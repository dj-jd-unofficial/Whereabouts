# CSS Formatting
This project was the first time I gained experience using css. Therefore, the naming conventions of selector names and the organization of selector blocks may not be the best. Some of the css is in the `styles.css` file in this directory, which applies throughout the whole Angular front-end app. Some of the css is local for each component in the [app folder](https://github.com/dj-jd-unofficial/Whereabouts/tree/master/Whereabouts/front-end/src/app).

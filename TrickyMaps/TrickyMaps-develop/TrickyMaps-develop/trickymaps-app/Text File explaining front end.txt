- in the assets folder there is a js folder. this folder contains javascript functions
- there is two files we had in this folder: script.js and api.js
- you wont get the api.js because i did not upload it to github
-  /* So the javascript file api.js with the 
          method getKey() is not on github. In order for this to work:
      1: create a new javascript file named 'api.js' 
      2: put it in the js folder in assets
      3: in that method, write:
        function getKey(){
          return ________; <- this is where the api key goes (put it in single quotation marks)
        } 
      ****api.js is included in the .gitignore file, this is why these steps are important*/
	  ****this method is called in the gameplay.component.ts file

- images/video/audio are located in assets folder
- the spec.ts files don't worry about (they are generated as you make a new component) i didnt code those
- dont need to edit index.html (only update the folders with the other html pages, .ts files and .css files)
- app.module.ts = imports of each componenet, and modules
- send-lat-long.service.ts gets lat and long of setup page and sends that information to gameplay page (get map working)
- send-json-data.service.ts gets data entered at setup page and sends that information to scoring page (gets video loaded from backend)

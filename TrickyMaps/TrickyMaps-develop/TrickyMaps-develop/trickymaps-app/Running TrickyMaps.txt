Here is how to run TrickyMaps:

First step is you need to get your Google API key. It should look something like 'AIzaSyDx1DNam-TwgiMqv2J5k12SNfXnVQRwgHA'
(that API key doesn't work anymore). You are going to need to put this in three places. First place is you need to make a file
called api.js under trickymaps-app -> src -> assets -> js

In there you will write:
function getKey(){
    return 'Enter your API Key';
}

You also need to enter your API key in trickymaps-api -> src -> gcputils.py -> line 8
As well as trickymaps-api -> src -> streetviewutils.py -> line 16

Next is in trickymaps-api -> src -> utils.py -> line 16
The FFMPEG path is needed to display the google maps interface. This is something you need to download. On MAC you can download
it through the terminal. On Windows you need to download it online and store it on your device. Then paste in the path of your
device. 

The other changes we had to make are already done and should work for you. 

Now to run it you are going to need to get a new terminal and then split your terminal. In one terminal you need to enter the 
following commands:
- cd TrickyMaps
- cd TrickyMaps-develop
- cd TrickyMaps-develop
- cd trickymaps-api
- cd src
- python server.py

These commands run  the flask server which runs the backend code. This needs to be going before you run the front end. If you
run the front end before the server you won't be able to see the google street view video or the google maps interface.

Now to run the front end in the other terminal (remember you are supposed to split terminals):
- cd TrickyMaps
- cd TrickyMaps-develop
- cd TrickyMaps-develop
- cd trickymaps-app
- ng serve -o

This will only work if you install angular. These are the Angular and node versions we used to get it running. Other versions we
tried couldn't get it to work.

Angular CLI: 11.1.4
Node: 16.0.0

Feel free to play with this as much as you want. I also filmed a youtube video of me running it and showing you what you need to
